"""The ontic-pages agent skill, installed for Claude Code and Codex on every run.

The skill text is package data (`skills/ontic-pages/SKILL.md`). Every command except `gateway`
and `skill` calls `sync_skill`, which copies it to `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude>/skills/` and
`<CODEX_HOME or ~/.codex>/skills/` when those agent folders exist (they are never created), so a
reinstall of the tool, which runs no code, still reaches the agents on the next run.

The installed copy carries a marker line after the frontmatter, with the skill's REVISION in it.
A file with our marker (or the one ontic-cli 0.29.0 wrote) is ours. It is rewritten when its
revision is lower, when it has none (the markers before revisions), or when it has this revision
with other text; one with a higher revision came from a newer ontic-pages and is left alone, so
an older install never puts its older text back. (Older installs look for their own exact
marker, which this one is not, so they leave a revised copy alone too.) A file without a marker
is the user's and is left alone, unless it is exactly the bundled text. A symlinked SKILL.md is
left alone. The sync costs a stat and a small read per target, prints only on a first install (to
stderr) and never raises. `ONTIC_AGENT_SKILLS=0` turns it off.
