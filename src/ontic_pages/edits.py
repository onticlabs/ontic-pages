"""Saving text edited in the bar as a new version. Nothing is overwritten.

The bar's edit mode (static/edit.js, static/edit-bridge.js) sends what the page's visible text was
and what it is now, per element: {version, path, changes: [{before, after}]}. Only the owner may
save, and only onto the current version. Each `before` is looked up in the HTML source of the file
at `path`, in its text only (not in tags, scripts, styles or the title), as written there: either
as is or with character references (&amp;, &#233;, &nbsp;). It must be found exactly once (a text
that fills a whole element wins over the same words inside a longer text); otherwise nothing is
saved and the answer names each change that could not be placed. Only the part that changed is
replaced, html-escaped.

The new version is the old one with that one file patched: every other file is copied inside the
bucket (copy_object; the bytes never pass through the gateway) while the gateway writes the
patched file (it is small), then page.json (published_by is the editor, the old description and
meta plus edited_from=<old version>, the old git), then `current`, as publish.py does.

It is quick: what the gateway keeps of the old version (page.json, its file list, the HTML it
served) is not read again, and what was written goes into those caches, so the answer and the
next save read nothing more. Only `current` is always asked of the bucket before it is written.
The time of each step goes into one log line per save.
