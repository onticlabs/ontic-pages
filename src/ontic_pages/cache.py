"""What the gateway keeps in memory.

A version never changes once written, so its files are kept (least recently used out first) by
(name, version, path), and so is the list of its files. Only `current`, `visibility` and the list
of versions can change; they are kept for a few seconds. A saved edit (edits.py) puts what it
wrote straight in, so the new version costs no read.
